# farming_simulator_autodrive_routes
Autodrive_config.xml files for farming simulator maps

**NOTE: I have just added the initial route file for FS25 Hutan Pantai. It has all the farms and delivery points added but not all of the fields yet. Its a work in progress**  
**Also moved fs22 routes to the FS22 folder**

To use simply copy the required map file to the savegame folder (e.g. savegame1) and rename it to Autodrive_config.xml. If the file already exists in the folder rename the original first (e.g. orig_Autodrive_config.xml) that way you can roll back if you want to.

Please Note:
* I have created folders to hold the POIs so please turn on the "use folders" option in the settings menu to enable them.
* These are routes I have created for my own use but have placed them here for others so you don't have to go through the very time consuming process yourself.
* Some routes on maps with very narrow roads (such as "The Green Valley") will need traffic turned of to avoid vehicle collisions.

Enjoy :-)
