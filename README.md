# fs22_autodrive_routes
Autodrive_config.xml files for farming simulator 2022 maps

To use simply copy the required map file to the FS22 savegame folder (e.g. savegame1) and rename it to Autodrive_config.xml. If the file already exists in the folder rename the original first (e.g. orig_Autodrive_config.xml) that way you can roll back if you want to.

Please Note:
* These are routes I have created for my own use but have placed them here for others to use if they so wish.
* Some routes such as "The Green Valley" will need traffic turned of to avoid vehicle collisions.

Enjoy :-)
